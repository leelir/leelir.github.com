&lt;p&gt;Five years ago I was honored to be a collage student of Shandong University of Finance and Economics. And now I am a graduate student in the same school. What make me feel most important things I have learned in the past five years is that following your curiosity and intuition. And then let me give some examples:&lt;br /&gt;
Our school is famous for its finance and economics, so most people choose these lessons, because it is advantageous for them to get a job in the bank, though they don’t really love it. At first, I also planned to learn economics, but after I read the book principles of economics, I found that I am really not interested in economics. In contract, I showed more and more curiosity on my major --- computer. I was lucky, I found what I really loved to do early in my college. At that time mobile phone just growth, my intuition told me that it with a brilliance future. I started to learn how to develop mobile applications with my self, which made me gain a lot until today.&lt;br /&gt;
It was the first year of my college time. During the next few years, I started to fascinated with hardware and open source project. At that time hardware was recognized out of date. However, I didn’t care about it, I just worked for my curiosity and interests. In order to buy hardware devices, I had to find a part time job. I worked for a research organization, and they paid me 600 yuan a month. I felt excited not only money, but also with what I learned in this work.&lt;br /&gt;
None of this had a positive influence for me to find a job in the bank, but I never regret about what I did. You have to trust in something like your destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because all the things we can catch is about now, you will never know what will happen in the future, but there most be some connection between what you are doing now and future.   &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="diary"></category></entry><entry><title>无题</title><link href="https://leelir.github.io/articles/just%20write.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-07-29T21:36:00+08:00</updated><author><name>leelir</name></author><id>tag:leelir.github.io,2015-07-29:articles/just write.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;好喜欢听梁静茹的歌啊，今晚上听了一晚。每次听都有一种全身都被触动的感觉，真的是很美好。忍不住都要跟着哼几下。等以后，我不一定回去亲临现场去听梁静茹的演唱会，也可能一辈子都见不到她，但我一定会买一个Walkman，把里面全部存她的歌，喜欢的歌静静地听。要是能在阳台上，吹着夏日的晚风，最好再来一杯加冰的威士忌。和自己喜欢的人在一起聊聊天，谈谈心。可以静静地凝视着她迷人的微笑。这就是我想要的生活。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;感谢美妙的歌声把我又带到了美好的画面，想想都觉得很美。&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="dairy"></category></entry><entry><title>headache</title><link href="https://leelir.github.io/articles/headache.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-07-28T21:01:00+08:00</updated><author><name>leelir</name></author><id>tag:leelir.github.io,2015-07-28:articles/headache.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;头疼了&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"All the power on earth can't change destiny."&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;从昨天在单位的椅子上躺着睡了一会一后就开始头疼了，也不知道怎么回事。每到这个时候我就害怕活着。希望明天能够快快好起来。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;明天就要开始看qt项目的代码了，争取这一周能弄明白这个。c++prime plus也要看。明天就要写点自己看的东西。单纯的回忆一天的收获。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;记录下每一天发生的事情，感觉挺好，前两天就像做个这样的东西，现在终于完成了。兴趣是最好的老师，这句话真的没有错。我以后就要想做什么就大胆的去做，该坚持的事情一定要坚持。&lt;/p&gt;
